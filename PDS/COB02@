0                      Julian-Gregorian Date Conversion Routine
-
        JULIAN is a subroutine that may be called from COBOL to convert a
        Julian date (i.e., year, day of year format) to a Gregorian date
        (i.e., month, day of month, year format) or vice versa.  It can also
      | be used to obtain the current date in both formats.  Optionally,
      | JULIAN can return the day of the week of the date converted or
      | obtained.  JULIAN uses a table lookup method which converts all valid
        dates from the year 1901 to 2099 correctly.  Note that the only
        validity check performed on the input date is a range check on the
        Gregorian month.
-       USAGE
0       JULIAN resides in the RICE.COBLIB library.  The ULIBDSN parameter of
        any ICSA COBOL cataloged procedure with link-edit or load steps may be
        used to access this library as follows:
0         cc 1
             //stepname   EXEC  procname,ULIBDSN='RICE.COBLIB'
0       Alternatively, the following SYSLIB DD cards may be added to JCL using
        any COBOL cataloged procedure with link-edit or load steps.
0         cc 1
             //step.SYSLIB  DD
             //             DD  DSN=RICE.COBLIB,DISP=SHR
0       In the JCL above, "step" refers to either LKED or GO depending on the
        cataloged procedure being used.  See ICSA Document COB001 and COB003
        for the placement of these cards in the deck and for additional
        information on the ULIBDSN parameter and the SYSLIB DD card.
0     | The JULIAN subroutine may be called with two or three arguments.  The
        first argument must be a five digit numeric field that is used for
        input/output of the Julian date represented by YYDDD; the second
        argument must be a six digit numeric field that is used for
      | input/output of the Gregorian date represented by MMDDYY.  The third
      | argument is optional; if provided, it must be a one digit numeric
      | field into which the day of the week will be placed (1=Sunday,
      | 2=Monday,...7=Saturday,0=don't know).  The arguments must be defined
        or defaulted as USAGE IS DISPLAY but need not be contiguous fields.
      | When JULIAN is called, one or both of the first two arguments must be
        zero (but not blank).  JULIAN converts the input dates as follows:
0         .  If only the Julian argument (i.e., the first argument) is zero,
             the Gregorian date in the second argument is converted to Julian
             format and stored in the first argument.
          .  If only the Gregorian argument (i.e., the second argument) is
             zero, the Julian date in the first argument is converted to
             Gregorian format and stored in the second argument.
          .  If both arguments are zero, the current date is converted to
             Julian and Gregorian formats and stored in the first and second
             arguments, respectively.
0     | If the day-of-week argument (i.e., the third argument) was specified,
      | a simplified version of Zeller's Congruence is used to compute the day
      | of the week.  Note that ridiculous dates will usually return a
      | "reasonable" value (e.g., the 32nd of December will be the day after
      | the 31st); a zero is returned only if a Gregorian date is supplied
      | with a month greater than twelve.
