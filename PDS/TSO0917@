0       The XSEND command is an enhanced version of the SEND command. This
      | command only supports messages from one logged-on user to another,
      | i.e., messages to the operator or to users who are not logged on must
      | still be sent via the SEND command.

0     | 'message' is the message text enclosed in quotes.  The message may be
      |      at most 235 characters.
0       USER(useridlist) is the list of recipients of the message. This is
             required.
0     | BELL indicates the bell on an ASCII terminal is to be sounded when the
      |      message is received and the prefix '*ATTN*' is to be typed on the
      |      terminal prior to typing the message. For EBCDIC terminals, for
      |      which no bell exists, only the prefix '*ATTN*' is sent.  ATTN is
      |      a synonym for BELL.
      | FLASH indicates that the bell is to be sounded on an ASCII terminal
      |      even if the user is not receiving messages (i.e., has set PROFILE
      |      NOINTERCOM).  For such a user, only the bell is sent; neither the
      |      message text nor the '*ATTN*' prefix will be received.  Users on
      |      EBCDIC terminals will not receive any indication of the attempt
      |      to send a message.
      | Note: If neither BELL nor FLASH is specified, these attention-getters
      | will not be sent.
0     | WAITÝ(interval)¨ indicates that the message is to be sent to every
      |      user in the list before the issuing user may proceed.  The
      |      subparameter "interval" may be used to specify the number of
      |      seconds (up to 99) the issuer is willing to wait for the message
      |      to be sent; if no interval is specified, there is no limit on the
      |      length of the wait.  Note that the WAIT may be cancelled at any
      |      time by use of the attention key (in which case any users who are
      |      still busy will not receive the message).
      | NOWAIT indicates that the message is to be cancelled for any busy user
      |      so that the issuing user does not have to wait to continue.  This
      |      is the default.
0     | INTERRUPT specifies that if a receiving user is entering input when
      |      the message is sent, he should be interrupted so it can be
      |      written immediately.  This specification will be ignored for some
      |      kinds of terminals (e.g., IBM 2741 terminals when the user has
      |      not issued TERM BREAK).
      | NOINTERRUPT specifies that a user active in input is not to be
      |      interrupted.  This is the default.

0     |      No message is sent to MORDRED's terminal, but the bell is sounded
      |      to indicate that an attempt was made to send a message.
