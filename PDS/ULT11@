-
        TAPESCAN is a utility program which can be used to print information
        about the contents of labeled or unlabeled tapes.  It may also be used
        to copy files from one tape to another.  When TAPESCAN is used to
        "scan" a tape, the following functions may be requested:
0     |   ®  A "volume table of contents" (VTOC) listing may be produced
      |      including, for labeled tapes, the name and DCB attributes of
      |      each file.
0     |   ®  The number of blocks and the minimum, maximum and average
             block length may be printed for each file.  This information
             is used to compute an estimate of the length of the used
             portion of the tape.
0         ®  A specified number of blocks from each file may be listed in
             character form.  Optionally, they may also be listed in
             hexadecimal.  Only the first 120 characters of each block are
             listed.
0         ®  Program operation may begin at any file of the input tape.
0         ®  Operation may continue past one or more end-of-volume
             indications.  This feature may allow the retrieval of some
             data from tape files which have been partially overwritten.
0       When TAPESCAN is used to copy, the following functions may be
        requested:
0         ®  All or part of one tape may be copied to another.  Output may
             start at any file of the output tape.
0         ®  All or part of an input tape may be copied onto the end of an
             output tape.
0         ®  When a labeled output tape is used, the output volume serial
             normally remains unchanged.  The user may request, however,
             that the output tape's label is to be copied from the input
             tape or is to be destroyed.
0       The following restrictions exist on the use of TAPESCAN.
0         ®  Files from an unlabeled tape may not be copied to a labeled
             tape unless the label is to be destroyed.
0         ®  Only a single volume may be used for input or output.
0         ®  TAPESCAN cannot copy to a completely blank output tape.  To
             use TAPESCAN to copy to such a tape, the user must first
             request initialization of the tape, as described in ICSA
             Document GEN008.
0         ®  All data files of a 7-track input tape must be written at the
             same density and using the same recording technique (TRTCH).
             These DCB parameters must be specified correctly in the JCL.
0       TAPESCAN was written by the Institute for Research in Social Sciences
        at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and has been
      | extensively modified by ICSA and other SHARE members.  TAPESCAN is
      | supported as class A1 software (i.e., consulting and maintenance are
      | available from ICSA).

-     | Three cataloged procedures are available to run TAPESCAN:  TAPESCAN,
      | TAPEMAP and TAPECOPY.  The function of each procedure is as follows:
0     |      TAPESCAN -- To scan a tape, producing a fairly verbose summary of
      |           the tape contents.  This PROC is recommended for unknown or
      |           possibly invalid tapes, or when a listing of data records is
      |           required.
0     |      TAPEMAP  -- To scan a tape, producing only a volume table of
      |           contents and diagnostic messages.  The omission of the label
      |           summary and listing of data records makes the output easier
      |           to read (and the run less expensive), but some details about
      |           "problem tapes" may be lost.  (See Appendix B for detailed
      |           information on the interpretation of the volume table of
      |           contents.)
0     |      TAPECOPY -- To copy one tape to another.
0       A listing of these procedures is available for reference in the User
        Clinic.  The Job Control Language (JCL) available at ICSA is described
      | in ICSA Document GEN001.  The JCL used with these procedures is
      | outlined below.

        A SETUP card is required for each tape to be read or written.  See
                  ICSA Document GEN001 for the format of this card.
0       The EXEC card may include the following symbolic parameters and
                  keyword operands:
0     |           OPTIONS='option-list' - may be used to specify execution
      |                options.  The options available are described in the
                       section labeled "OPTIONS SUMMARY" below.
0                 ISER=input-volser - specifies the volume serial number of
                       the input tape volume.  This parameter is required and
                       must correspond to the volume serial specified on the
                       SETUP card for this tape.
0                 IUNIT=input-unit - indicates the type of tape drive to be
                       used for the input tape.  The value coded should be a
                       valid value for the UNIT keyword on the DD statement
                       and correspond to the UNIT specified on the SETUP card.
                       Valid values include TAPE9 for a 9-track 1600/6250 bpi
                       drive, 'T8/16' for a 9-track 800/1600 bpi drive, and
                       TAPE7 for a 7-track 200/556/800 bpi drive.  See the
                       discussion of the DD card in ICSA Document GEN001 for a
                       complete list of the valid unit names for tape drives
                       at ICSA.  The default is IUNIT=TAPE9.
0                 ILABTYP=label-type - may be used to specify the type of
                       label (i.e., SL, AL or NL) the input tape is believed
                       to possess.  In most cases, a tape can be scanned or
                       mapped successfully even if the label type is specified
                       incorrectly.  If no label-type is specified, the input
                       tape is assumed to be unlabeled.
0                 IFILE=fileno - may be used to indicate the number of the
                       first tape file to be scanned or copied.  The default
                       is IFILE=1.
0     | The following keywords apply only to the TAPECOPY PROC.
0                 OSER=output-volser - specifies the volume serial number of

                       the output tape volume.  This parameter is required for
                       a copy operation and must correspond to that coded on
                       the SETUP card for the output tape.  For a labeled
                       output tape, the output-volser must be the same as that
                       specified in the tape label itself.
0                 OUNIT=output-unit - indicates the type of tape drive to be
                       used for the output tape.  The values allowed for this
                       keyword are the same as for the IUNIT keyword, as
                       described above.  The default is OUNIT=TAPE9.
0                 OLABTYP=label-type - must be used to specify the label type
      |                for an output tape (SL, AL or NL).  This must specify
      |                the way the tape is labeled before the copy; if OLABTYP
      |                is not specified correctly, the tape will not be used
      |                for output.  Note:  To copy an unlabeled tape onto a
      |                previously labeled tape, or vice versa, the UNLABEL
      |                option (described below in the "OPTIONS SUMMARY"
      |                section) must be specified.
0                 OFILE=fileno - may be used to indicate the number of the
                       first output file If OFILE is not specified, output
                       begins at the first file of the tape, unless the option
                       EOVMOD (described below in the "OPTIONS SUMMARY"
                       section) is used.
0                 ODEN=output-density - specifies the recording density for
      |                the output tape. The valid values for this keyword are
      |                0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, for 200, 556, 800, 1600 and 6250 bpi
      |                respectively.  For 9-track tapes, ODEN is ignored
      |                except in cases where the first block of the tape is
      |                rewritten (i.e., it is ignored when the OFILE parameter
      |                is greater than 1, or when the output tape is labeled
      |                and the UNLABEL option is not specified).  For 7-track
      |                tapes, ODEN must specify the density at which the
      |                output tape is currently recorded.  The default ODEN is
      |                the highest density supported by the tape drive (i.e.,
      |                4 if OUNIT=TAPE9, 3 if OUNIT='T8/16', and 2 if
      |                OUNIT=TAPE7).
0     | The following parameters are meaningful only for seven-track tapes.
      | They are ignored for nine-track tapes.
0                 IDEN=input-density - specifies the recording density for the
                       input tape.  This parameter is required for 7-track
                       tapes not recorded at the default density of 800 bpi.
                       Valid values are 0, 1, and 2 corresponding to 200, 556,
                       and 800 bpi respectively.
0                 ITRTCH=input-recording-technique - specifies the recording
                       technique for a 7-track input tape.  This corresponds
                       to the DCB subparameter TRTCH on the DD statement
                       described in the MVS JCL Manual.  Valid values are E,

                       ET, T, and C.  If omitted, odd parity, no translation,
                       and no code conversion are assumed.  See the IBM
                       manual, OS/VS Tape Labels, for more information.

0                 OTRTCH=output-recording-technique - specifies the recording
      |                technique for a 7-track output tape (used with the
      |                TAPECOPY PROC only).  The valid values for this keyword
                       are the same as for the ITRTCH keyword, as described
                       above.  If OTRTCH is omitted, odd parity, no
                       translation and no code conversion are assumed.

                                   TAPESCAN OPTIONS
-     | TAPESCAN options are specified through the OPTIONS parameter of the
      | EXEC statement.  Options are provided to specify the amount and type
        of output, the number and position of tape files to be processed, and
      | whether or not tape copying or ASCII translation is to be performed.
      | The valid TAPESCAN options are described below.  Each option is
      | followed by an indication, within parentheses, of the PROCs for which
      | it is valid (where S indicates the TAPESCAN PROC, M the TAPEMAP PROC
      | and C the TAPECOPY PROC).
0     | NOSUM (S) - specifies that a summary of label information (for a
      |      labeled input tape) is not wanted.  This also suppresses the
      |      volume table of contents.
      | FULLSUM (S,C) - specifies that each input tape label is to be listed
      |      in addition to the normal summary information.
      | MAPONLY (C) - specifies that only a volume table of contents is wanted
      |      (i.e., that the normal, more verbose label summary is to be
      |      suppressed).  Note that MAPONLY is ignored if the LIST option is
      |      specified.  MAPONLY is implied when the TAPEMAP procedure is
      |      used, and should not be specified explicitly with this PROC.
      |      MAPONLY may be abbreviated as MAP.
0     | Note: If none of NOSUM, FULLSUM, or MAPONLY is specified (for the
      | TAPESCAN and TAPECOPY PROCs), a detailed summary of information from
      | the labels is printed for each file of a labeled tape, in addition to
      | the normal VTOC listing described below.  Information printed includes
        the file sequence number, data set name, creation date, date of last
      | modification, expiration date, number of blocks in the file (BLOCK
      | COUNT), protection status, and the name of the job and job step which
        created the file.  The DCB parameters RECFM, LRECL, BLKSIZE, TRTCH and
        (for an ASCII tape only) BUFOFF are also printed.  See the IBM manual,
        OS/VS Tape Labels, for further information on the interpretation of
+       _____ ____ ______
        the contents of tape labels.
0     | COUNT (S,M) - specifies that the number of blocks on each tape file is
      |      to be determined, together with the maximum, minimum and average
      |      block length.  This is normally the default.
        NOCOUNT (S,M) - specifies that block count and length information are
             not to be determined.  This option reduces the number of I/O
             operations required to process a tape.  NOCOUNT is recommended
      |      only for use with labeled tapes.  NOCOUNT is the default when the
      |      TAPEMAP PROC is used with a labeled tape.
0     | LIST=n (S,C) - specifies that the first 120 characters of the first n
      |      records of each input file are to be printed.  The default is
      |      LIST=4 except when MAPONLY is specified (or defaulted by the
      |      TAPEMAP PROC).
      | NOLIST (S,C) - specifies that input data records are not to be listed.
      |      If MAPONLY is specified, NOLIST is the default.
0     | HEX (S,C) - specifies that listed data records and/or labels are to be
      |      printed in hexadecimal as well as in character form.
0     | LINE=nn (S,M,C) - specifies the number of lines to be printed per
      |      page.  The default is 59.
0     | SKIPTM=n (S,M,C) - specifies the number of tape marks (which separate
      |      physical tape files) to be skipped on the input tape before
             beginning processing.  Note that before the tape marks are
             skipped, the tape is positioned as specified by the IFILE
             parameter of the EXEC card.  SKIPTM will not cause a tape to be
+                                                     ___
             positioned beyond an end-of-volume indication, unless special
             action is taken, as described in Appendix C.  Note that on a
             labeled tape there will be three tapemarks for each data file.
0     | STOPTM=n (S,M,C) - specifies the maximum number of physical input tape
      |      files to be processed.  Files skipped as a result of the IFILE
             parameter of the EXEC statement or the SKIPTM option are not
             included in this count.  STOPTM will not cause a tape to be
+                                                 ___
             processed beyond an end-of-volume indication, except by use of
             the options described in Appendix C.  If STOPTM is not specified,
             processing will terminate upon reaching an end-of-volume
             indication.  Note that, for a labeled tape, three physical files
             exist for each data file on the tape.
0     | ERRLIM=n (S,M,C) - specifies the maximum acceptable number of I/O
      |      errors.  The default is ERRLIM=5.  Until the I/O error limit is
             reached, program operation will continue, without regard to any
1
        UTL011 - Appendix A - 17 September 1982                        Page A2
-
             error indications.  When an input error occurs, data will be used
             exactly as received.  This may cause incorrect information and/or
             incorrect-length blocks to be written to an output tape.
0     | EOVMOD (C) - specifies that the input tape is to be copied onto the
      |      end of the output tape (i.e., after the output tape's current
             last file).  If a file number is specified in the JCL OFILE
             parameter, the point at which to begin output is determined by
             locating the first end-of-volume indication after the specified
             file of the output tape.  When the number of the last file on a
      |      tape is known, ICSA recommends the use of the OFILE JCL parameter
      |      in place of EOVMOD, to be sure that output begins at the right
             file of the tape.
0     | UNLABEL (C) - specifies that the copy operation is allowed to destroy
      |      the output volume label, change the output volume serial number,
      |      or write labels on a previously unlabeled tape.  If UNLABEL is
             not specified, the output volume serial will not be changed.
             Note that UNLABEL should NEVER be used if either the input or
             output tape is an ICSA R7 or R9 series tape.
0     | ASCII=IN (S,M,C) - specifies that the input tape contains information
      |      coded in ASCII.  This parameter need not be specified if the
             input tape has ANSI standard labels; it will be ignored if the
             input tape has IBM standard labels.  Note that TAPESCAN cannot
             successfully convert ASCII data sets with record format D to
             EBCDIC.
0     | ASCII=OUT (C) - specifies that the output tape is to contain
      |      information coded in ASCII.  This parameter need not be specified
             if the output tape has ANSI standard labels; it will be ignored
             if the output tape has IBM standard labels.  Note that TAPESCAN
             cannot successfully convert EBCDIC data sets with record format V
             to ASCII.  Warning: TAPESCAN may be used to produce ASCII tapes
             containing data sets with a block size less than 18 or greater
             than 2048; such data sets are in violation of the ANS standards
             for tape labeling and may cause problems in later use.

                         READING THE VOLUME TABLE OF CONTENTS
-     | The TAPESCAN VTOC listing is printed in a columnar format, with
      | occasional footnotes if any unusual conditions are detected.  An
      | initial heading line gives the volume serial number, owner
      | identification, density, recording technique and label type of the

0     | Individual columns in the table of contents are as follows:
0     |    SEQ - the sequence number of the file.  For a labeled file, this is
      |         taken from the label; for an unlabeled file, it is the
      |         physical file number on the tape.
0     |    DATA SET NAME - the data set name.  For an unlabeled file, the
      |         constant "*NO LABEL*" appears.  Other special cases are
      |         "*TAPEMARK*", for an empty, unlabeled data set, and
      |         "*IEHINITT*", for the first file of an initialized, unused
      |         tape.
0     |    LABEL - the label type of the data set.  If this file has a
      |         different label type than any previous file, or some other
      |         condition would prevent access to it using normal JCL, a label
      |         type of "BLP" is substituted.  In most cases, a footnote will
      |         be generated for the first file with a label type of "BLP".
0     |    RECFM - the file's DCB record format.  This column is empty for an
      |         unlabeled file; if labels are present, but do not contain DCB
      |         information, the record format will be printed as "??".
0     |    LRECL - the file's DCB logical record length.  This column is empty
      |         for an unlabeled file; if labels are present, but do not
      |         contain DCB information, the record length will be printed as
      |         "??".
0     |    BLKSIZE - the file's DCB block size.  This column is empty for an
      |         unlabeled file; if labels are present, but do not contain DCB
      |         information, the block size will be printed as "??".
0     |    EXPIRES - the data set's expiration date.  This column is empty for
      |         an unlabeled file; it may be written as "NONE", if there is no
      |         expiration date, or as "INVALID", if the date is invalid.
0     |    BLK COUNT - the number of blocks in the data set.  If the COUNT
      |         option is specified, this is the actual number of data blocks;
      |         if NOCOUNT is in effect, this is obtained from the labels for
      |         a labeled data set, or omitted for an unlabeled data set.
0     |    MAX BLK - the maximum block size for the file.  This column appears
      |         only if the COUNT option was specified or defaulted.
0     |    MIN BLK - the minimum block size for the file.  This column appears
      |         only if the COUNT option was specified or defaulted.
0     |    AVG BLK - the average block size for the file.  This column appears
      |         only if the COUNT option was specified or defaulted.

                        ACCESSING DATA BEYOND "END OF VOLUME"
-       Occasionally, there is need to access data recorded on a tape beyond
        an end-of-volume indication (two consecutive tapemarks).  There are
        two possible reasons for such access.  First, if a tape file contains
        no data, a double tapemark will occur, even though more files may
        physically follow on the tape.  Second, when a tape is overwritten, an
        end-of-volume indication is automatically written at the conclusion of
        output.  Any previously written information beyond this indication
        will remain recorded on the tape, and all but the first block thereof
        can usually be read without error.  Thus, when a tape has been
        erroneously overwritten, some of the previously recorded information
        may be accessible beyond the end-of-volume indication.
0       TAPESCAN provides two additional options to allow the reading of
        information beyond an end-of-volume indication, as follows:
0       SKIPEOV=n - specifies the number of end-of-volume indications to be
             skipped on the input tape before beginning processing.  SKIPEOV
             processing is performed after the input tape is positioned to the
             file indicated in the IFILE JCL parameter.  If SKIPTM and SKIPEOV
             are specified together, the SKIPTM processing is performed after
             the SKIPEOV processing is complete.  The default for this option
             is SKIPEOV=0, specifying that processing is to begin at the start
             of the tape.
0       STOPEOV=n - specifies the number of end-of-volume indications to be
             processed before processing is terminated.  The default is
             STOPEOV=1, which indicates that processing is stopped the first
             time end of volume is indicated.  If both STOPTM and STOPEOV are
             specified, processing will terminate when either the indicated
             number of tape marks or the indicated number of end-of-volume
             indications are encountered.
0       Note that when SKIPEOV and/or STOPEOV are used with a tape which has
        been overwritten, an I/O error should be expected on the first block
        following the end-of-volume indication.
0       Even with the options described above, attempting to retrieve data
        recorded beyond an end-of-volume indication can be frustrating and
        time-consuming.  For this reason, ICSA strongly recommends that users
        who need to use the SKIPEOV and/or STOPEOV options see the consultant
        in the User Clinic before attempting their use, especially with a tape
        which has been overwritten.
-       Example 1: Scan a 9-track tape whose label type is unknown, getting
             information about the maximum and minimum length of each block.
             List the first 120 characters of 10 records from each data file.
             Continue past the first end-of-volume indication until a second
             end-of-volume indication is located.

        Example 2: Copy information after the first end-of-volume indicator on
             an overwritten tape to an unlabeled tape.  Terminate the copy if
             more than one I/O error occurs.  Note that an overwritten input
             tape should be described in the JCL as unlabeled, even if labels
             are present, or were present before the overwriting.  This
             misrepresentation may be necessary because any tape labels still
             present beyond the end-of-volume indication are unlikely to
             correctly describe the remaining data.
