0                    Printing and Punching Partitioned Data Sets
-
        PRINTPDS and PUNCHPDS are ICSA-written utility programs which may be
        used to print or punch all members of a partitioned data set (PDS).
        PRINTPDS may be used to list a PDS of any record format and record
        length.  The listing includes a table of contents to allow a
        particular member to be quickly found in the listing.  PUNCHPDS may be
        used to punch any card-image PDS.  The format of the output allows the
        PDS to be recreated by the use of the IBM utility IEBUPDTE.
0       PRINTPDS and PUNCHPDS are supported as class A1 software (i.e.,
        program maintenance and consulting are supplied by ICSA).
-       USAGE
0       The JCL to run PRINTPDS or PUNCHPDS is outlined below.

             /*JOBPARM                                             required

0       A SETUP card is required if a PDS on an off-line private disk volume
                  is to be printed or punched.  See ICSA Document GEN001 for
                  the format of this card.
0       A JOBPARM is required to specify the BIN number of the output.  It is
                  also used for the following cases:
0                 If the PDS is to be punched, the CARDS parameter must be
                  used to specify the maximum number of cards to be punched.
0                 If the PDS to be printed is a print file (i.e., the record
                  format contains an A or M, indicating that the record
                  contains ASA or machine control characters), the LINECT=0
                  parameter must be specified to prevented unwanted page
                  ejects.
0                 See ICSA Document GEN001 for further information about the
                  JOBPARM card.
0       The EXEC card should specify either PRINTPDS or PUNCHPDS as
                  "procname".  The following symbolic parameter is supported
                  on the EXEC card for both procedures:
0                 DSN='dsname' - specifies the name of the PDS to be printed
                       or punched.  This parameter is required.
0                 The following symbolic parameters are supported only for
                  PRINTPDS:
0                 FORMS=formno - specifies the form number to be used when
                       printing the PDS listing.  If this parameter is
                       omitted, the listing is produced on standard forms.
                       See ICSA Document GEN009 for a list of the special
                       forms available at ICSA.
0                 TRAIN=train - specifies the print train to be used when
                       printing the PDS.  If omitted, the PN train is used.
                       For further information on print trains, see ICSA
                       Document GEN009.
0                 CTAPE=ctape - specifies the carriage tape to be used when
                       printing the PDS.  If omitted, the default carriage
                       tape is used.  For further information on carriage
                       tapes, see ICSA Document GEN009.

-
                  LINECT=lines-per-page - specifies the number of lines to be
                       printed on each page of the PDS listing.  The default
                       value is 55.  If LINECT is set larger than 61, the
                       LINECT parameter of the JOBPARM card must also be
                       specified.  The LINECT parameter is ignored when a
                       RECFM A or M data set is printed.
